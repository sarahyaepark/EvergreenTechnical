"LeadIQ, Inc",Software,https://leadiq.com/,"Prospecting should be fun and easy. Sadly, many sales reps hate prospecting. That's why we built LeadIQ. LeadIQ eliminates the most annoying parts of prospecting, helping sales reps get new deals with less work. The average sales rep only spends 1/4 of their time actually prospecting. That's because reps spend their days looking up prospects in Salesforce, researching them on the web, finding lead contact info, and doing manual data entry. That's not why you hired your sales team, it's not why they work in sales, and it just isn't a good use of anyone's time. With millions of emails, phone numbers, titles, and accounts, our prospecting platform makes it easy to focus on your pitch and build relationships, without sacrificing a clean Salesforce.
